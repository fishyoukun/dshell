# dshell
a re-edition ushell tool for the one which I used in my previous company 

when I worked in my previous company, there is a utility called ushell, which is a great tool for debuging the binary in linux.
and I would like to re-edition it although I don't have the code of it.

the code here is based on my understanding on linux, I don't guarantee it will functions as the origin one.

Thank you very much.
